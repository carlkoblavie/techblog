Don't get me wrong, I love Expresspay. Until recently I used it for all my money transactions;   
Sending money instantly to someone's bank account, purchase air time for my phone, purchase internet bundles, pay water bill, sending money to other other mobile networks occassionally pay bills such hospital bill (at Rabito Hospital) amongst others. Expresspay for a long time has been my go to 'payment' app until recently.
