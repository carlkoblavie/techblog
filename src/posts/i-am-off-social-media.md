My relationship with social media has been one of love/hate. Facebook and Instagram were my early social media hangout places. They brought me close to former mates and colleagues. Twitter, later on, introduced me to a lot of new influencers and ideas that I've found very beneficial.

Yet, in recent times, social media has contributed to a lot of time-wasting. I have already left Facebook. Though I still have an active account there, I haven’t posted anything in the past half-decade. 

Instagram is also another beautiful time-wasting sink for me. Scrolling through posts, watching very interesting short videos. Though I learn a thing or two, I find the amount of time I spent here a bit too much.

Twitter is my favourite social media. I've gotten immense value from Twitter by following the right kind of people. I've learnt a lot of interesting concepts and ideas. Yet I've also realised I fill almost every idle time scrolling through Twitter. This was getting out of hand.

So, I have now logged out of all my social media accounts; Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. Twitter was the hardest to give up. I often get the urge to log back in, especially on Football afternoons.
I couldn't get off WhatsApp. Family and friends rely on that to keep in touch; whilst groups and societies I belong to use that to get organised.

It’s too early to tell if this has improved my focus or not. One thing is clear though; now I do not spend my first waking moments checking Twitter. This forces me to settle down and have my morning prayers, work on my draft posts or work on a side project. That is a huge win!
