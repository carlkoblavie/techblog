<p>Don't get me wrong, I love Expresspay. Until recently I used it for all my money transactions;<br>
Sending money instantly to someone's bank account, purchase air time for my phone, purchase internet bundles, pay water bill, sending money to other other mobile networks occassionally pay bills such hospital bill (at Rabito Hospital) amongst others. Expresspay for a long time has been my go to 'payment' app until recently.</p>
<p>However, recently, my bank has stepped up. Their mobile app has improved quite a lot. So now, I use my bank's app for transactions such as sending money instantly to a bank account, sending money to a mobile number, purchasing air time top ups. The simple reason is, though their interface is less user friendly, their transaction fee is cheaper than Expresspay.</p>
