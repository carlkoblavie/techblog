<ol>
<li>Create the folder in a location that makes sense. For example, you can create it in <code>/Users/Shared</code> directory
which is designed for shared content.
In your Terminal type the following command to crete the shared folder</li>
</ol>
<p>`
sudo mkdir -p /Users/Shared/technotes</p>
<p>`
[comment]: # (TODO: Explain why we are using sudo)</p>
<p>Replace <code>technotes</code> with your desired folder name</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Set Group ownership:
You can create a group that includes all the users who need access to the shared folder. Then assign ownership of the folder to that group. LEt's call this group <code>techies</code>
`
sudo dseditgroup -o create techies
sudo chown :techies /Users/Shared/technotes</li>
</ol>
<p>`</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Add Users to the Group:
Add the user profiles that should have access to the shared folder to the newly created group. Let's assume we have a profile with username <code>esinam</code></li>
</ol>
<p><code>sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a esinam -t user techies</code></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Set Folder Permissions:
Set the appropriate permissions for the shared folder to allow group members to access it</li>
</ol>
<p><code>sudo chmod 770 /Users/Shared/technotes</code></p>
<p>The <code>770</code> permissions ensure that the owner and the group members have read, write, and execute access to the folder.</p>
<p>Now, users who are part of the shared group should be able to access the folder and its contents. They can read, write, and manage files within the shared folder.</p>
